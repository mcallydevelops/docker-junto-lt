   - If you run into any issues trying running `brew doctor` and following the suggested actions
3) Install docker by visiting https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/ and following the instructions
    - If everything worked correctly you should be able to run `docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started`
